## Mentors

Thanks for helping us mentor our Full-Stack 101 workshop!

Here is a breakdown of the expectations of being a mentor for this workshop:

Before the workshop, take a look at the notes. Familiarize yourself with the concepts we will be covering.

Please wear a nametag that says your name and that you're a mentor.

When students arrive, please greet them with a welcoming hello! Walk them into class. Once they are seated, ensure they have access to the wifi and notes. We will require students to sign up for a Repl.it account, so if they arrive early you can help them get sorted with that.

Students are shy! When they arrive please start a conversation with them. Ask them if they've done any coding before, ask why they are interested in coding, tell them about how you got started coding.

As the workshop is in session, please wander around the room and check in with students periodically. If you need help grab another mentor or the instructor. Often times students will struggle silently and once you ask them a question they will open up.

When helping a student, stick to the concepts we will cover in the workshop. If a student has a question you know we won't get to answer during the workshop, let them know we won't get to cover it today, but it's a concept that is covered in our other courses.

A lot of students will have questions about our Bootcamp. If you don't feel comfortable answering them, grab the instructor or a Juno College staff member. If no one is available, give them one of our admissions team members business cards.

## Instructors

Thanks for teaching with us!

Here is a breakdown of the expectations of instructing this workshop:

Please familiarize yourself with: the notes, Repl, and the project you will build.

The "exercise" time is meant to be fully guided. The goal is to have a completed project by the end of the class! We can ensure students have a great final project if we go through the steps together.

There are times when we don't go into a ton of detail. This is to ensure there is enough time to get through the content.

As students are arriving, please play some music. [(We really love the Lush Vibes playlist on Spotify, feel free to use that one!](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/5jYZEwlmZeEXmnzA8aeAWk). We also ask that you have the slideshow (linked above) playing. Feel free to chat with the mentors, but we also ask you chat with students as they come in. Students and mentors will rely on you to set the tone of the workshop. Please try to make everyone feel welcomed.

A great way to begin the workshop is to ask the group who has some coding experience. It gives you a good reference for who is in the room. Teach to those who have never coded before, review for those with experience is fine! 

If you have any questions or comments about the notes, please email <a href="mailto:tiffany@hackeryou.com">tiffany@hackeryou.com.</a> Also, feel free to make a pull request with changes.

### Thank you!
